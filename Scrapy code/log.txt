EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said there was no desire to punish the UK but "its accounts must be settled". While he wanted a "cordial" Brexit, he warned the "clock was ticking" now.Publishing his Brexit mandate, Mr Barnier said the EU would "put all its efforts" into reaching a deal but said negotiations must start as soon as possible after "ten months of uncertainty" and suggested the outcome of June\'s general election would not change anything. \n\n\n            /**/\n            (function() {\n                if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.adverts && bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync) {\n                    bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync(\'mpu\', [1,2,3]);\n                }\n            })();\n            /**/\n        \n\n\nGeneral election: latest\nPM: I\'ll be bloody difficult to Juncker\nBrexit: All you need to know\nWhere UK parties stand on Brexit\nWhile approaching the process in a "cool-headed and solution-oriented" manner, he said it was an illusion to think it would be concluded "quickly and painlessly" or that there would be "no material impact" on lives. An EU source has told the BBC that officials in Brussels will not enter into a discussion about potential figures for a final bill, likely to be one of the hardest-fought and most sensitive areas of the Brexit process.On Wednesday, the Financial Times claimed the likely bill had risen sharply from 60bn to 100bn euros, basing its calculations on new data from across Europe.\n\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\n\n\n\n\n\n Media captionBrexit Secretary David Davis tells Today EU nationals can expect "generous settlement"\nMr Barnier said there was no agreed figure but the UK and EU had entered into "mutual commitments" which must be honoured. "There is no Brexit bill. The final settlement is all about settling the accounts."Mr Davis said the negotiations had not started in earnest but he indicated the UK would set down a marker when it came to talks over the divorce settlement."We are not supplicants," he said. "This is a negotiation. They lay down what they want and we lay down what we want."Various figures ranging from 50bn to 100bn euros had been knocking around, he said, but he had "not seen" any official numbers. Asked directly whether a figure of 100bn euros - was acceptable, he replied: "We will not be paying \u20ac100bn."\n\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device\n\n\n\n\n\n Media captionEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier gives his view of Brexit "illusion"\nHe added: "We will do it properly. We will take our responsibilities seriously. What we\'ve got to do is discuss in detail what the rights and obligations are."We have said we will meet our international obligations, but there will be our international obligations including assets and liabilities and there will be the ones that are correct in law, not just the ones the Commission want."He subsequently told the BBC that the 100bn euro figure should be viewed "with a pinch of salt" and the negotiations would not "end up there", adding that it was up to the two sides to agree and he did not want the European Court of Justice to become involved.Many Conservative MPs argue the UK does not owe the EU anything given the size of the contributions it has made over the past 40 years. A recent report by a House of Lords committee argued the UK was not legally obliged to pay a penny although to do this would threaten any chance of a post-Brexit trade deal. If the UK was to walk away without a deal, Mr Davis conceded that it would not owe anything but he insisted "nobody was seeking that outcome"."We want a deal. We think we can get a deal that is beneficial to everybody" he told Radio 4\'s Today. \'Gossip and spin\'Some sort of financial resolution is seen by the EU as a precondition for opening talks on a trade deal.There are reports in Brussels that the rising figure might include demands from countries like France and Poland for UK contributions to farm subsidies. The EU may also be planning to refuse to allow the UK a share of the EU\'s assets including buildings and bank deposits.Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank, said a range of factors would have to be taken into account - including the UK\'s rebate on budget payments and its share of EU borrowing - but he believed a credible figure would be somewhere between 25bn and 65bn euros. There have been growing tensions between the UK and EU since a dinner in Downing Street last week, in which European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is reported to have told Theresa May that Brexit could not be a success.Mr Davis, who was one of ten people present at the dinner, said accounts of the meeting were "gossip and spin" and while there were some differences in key areas, the atmosphere had been "constructive" rather than hostile.While the process was currently in a "rough and tumble" phase of manoeuvring, he believed a "generous settlement" could be reached over the status of EU nationals living in the UK and Britons living on the continent which guaranteed "pretty much exactly" the same rights they enjoy at the moment.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the 100bn euro figure was the "opening gambit of negotiations" but that commitments that have been made by the UK government must be honoured.For the Lib Dems, Tim Farron said no divorce bill had ever been mentioned during last year\'s referendum and it strengthened his party\'s call for a further vote on the terms of exit. But UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said talk of a 100bn euro figure was "ridiculous" and the UK "should not be paying anything at all". What is your question about the \'divorce bill\'?

Growing up in diamond-rich eastern Sierra Leone, it was the natural thing to do. Jobs were, and still are, few and far between, so the gemstones were a magnet. They persuaded many to drop out of school, but I worked as a miner mostly during school holidays and sometimes at weekends.  The Kono District was densely populated because the sparkling stones could be found virtually everywhere, sometimes through sheer luck.My parents joined thousands of people from across the country, as well as The Gambia, Mali, Senegal and even Lebanon, to go to Kono in the hope of making a quick fortune.\n\n\n            /**/\n            (function() {\n                if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.adverts && bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync) {\n                    bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync(\'mpu\', [1,2,3]);\n                }\n            })();\n            /**/\n        \n\nBlistered palmsI grew up there and my work as a miner was hard. I dug the river beds for gravel and extracted the often muddy earth looking for diamonds. The pickaxes and shovels would blister my palms and the sieve would harden or even deaden my fingers, often breaking my fingernails. And because I had to also lift sacks full of dry red tropical gravel, my head and neck were almost always in pain. Diamond deposits were sometimes so close to the surface in parts of Kono that it was common for people to pick up tiny gemstones that had been loosened by a heavy downpour. I found a tiny stone once or twice in my birthplace, Bumpeh. I did not know their true worth, but got enough money to see me through for about a week.

Incomparable Diamond, found in DR Congo in 1984, weighed 890 caratsSource: Mathew Nyaungwa, Rough and Polished\nPastor finds huge diamond\nPictures of life of a diamond miner\nWhy have so many huge diamonds been found recently?\nAfter doing my school-leaving exams, I took to full-scale mining to help pay for my university studies. Apart from mining in Kono, I also went to Tongo Fields in neighbouring Kenema District. There, I discovered that the life of an artisanal miner was like that of an indentured labourer. Diamond diggers generally had two layers of sponsorship, and still do. The Group of Geng, or Gang, is what the diggers are called. \n\n\n\nIn language which harks back to the days of slavery, each group has a Master who looks over them. He is also in charge of providing food, accommodation and medicine. But when I was there, conditions were such that only one square meal a day was assured - and please do not ask how the sauce tasted. We often slept on the floor of a room or veranda, with bedbugs and mosquitoes biting us in turns. As for health care, Panadol was all we would get if we fell ill. Then there was the Supporter - the person who would provide the funds for the Master. We rarely got to know him personally. He tended to be a big businessman or diamond dealer, and he provided us with tools and monthly allowances. Like me, most diggers did not know - and still do not know - the real value of their diamonds. So, it was easy for the Master and the Supporter to connive and dupe us about the price.  \n\n\nImage copyright\nOlivia Acland \n\n\nImage caption\n\n                    It takes sharp eyes to spot some diamonds\n                \n\nThere is a group known as Gado Geng. They prefer to sponsor themselves and sell their diamonds on their own.But my three-member team had a Master. We worked on a licensed plot. However, one day, we went to do illicit mining at an abandoned site belonging to the then state-owned National Diamond Mining Company. Sparkling objectTwo of us were on the sieve, the third shovelling the pile of gravel. I was busy shaking the sieve under the water to wash the mud off the stones. Then I saw a sparkling object right in the middle of the sieve. I was not sure if it was a diamond or corundum, a sparkling stone that has little value. I brought up the sieve, to be sure.    I went straight to the spot to try to separate it from the rest of the stones and sand. My heart pounded. I excitedly muttered to my colleagues: "Na diamond," a Krio phrase for "It\'s a diamond". I made sure that I did not say it loudly for fear that someone in the distance would hear me. \n\n\nImage copyright\nUmaru Fofana\n\n\nImage caption\n\n                    This is one of the few photos Umaru still has of his time at university\n                \n\nMy colleague, Yarpo, dropped the bucket and shovel to verify my find. He agreed that it was a diamond. We flung the tools away and dashed into the tall swampy grass. We then fled before anyone could catch us. Obviously, we kept our Master in the dark and sold the two-carat diamond to a local dealer for 100,000 leone. I am not sure how many US dollars that was worth in 1991, but it was a lot of money.I was the youngest, but the other two diggers treated me fairly.  We split the money, and they gave me 34,000 leone, a little more than my share. Unlike many other diamond diggers, I did not waste any of it on buying brightly-coloured sneakers, jeans, shirts or cassette players.I had a clear idea what I was going to do with it - pay my first year university fee of around 24,000 leone. Dream fulfilledAs I was still awaiting my school exam results, I  gave the money to my aunt to add to her capital and do some business. I went back to concentrate on mining, but it turned out to be the last time that fortune would smile on me as a digger.  I always wanted to become a journalist as I was born with the BBC World Service blaring in our home. My dad, who never went to school, was addicted to it. And there were old newspapers and magazines lined up under his mattress and piled up elsewhere in his tiny bedroom. However, Sierra Leone\'s Fourah Bay College did not offer journalism at the time. So, my instinct told me to study English and French for an international edge. I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and went on to work as journalist.Like me, my children have grown up with the BBC World Service , except that my voice is among the voices that they hear.\n', u'How I funded my studies by digging for Sierra Leone diamonds']

['http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39774674', u'\n\n\n\nImage copyright\nAFP\n\nPackaged as a self-help manual for the modern working mom, Ivanka Trump\'s new book, Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success, hit the shelves and shipped from Amazon storerooms on Tuesday.To avoid accusations that Ms Trump is taking advantage of her White House platform to sell books, the president\'s daughter has promised to donate profits to charity and has declined to do any publicity around the release. Reviewers of the book so far have fallen into one of two camps.In the minds of some, Ms Trump has taken on a serious tone in her new book, showing an evolution from the young, inexperienced-but-nonetheless-successful businesswoman she was at 27, when she wrote "The Trump Card", to a busy - so busy - married mother of three, who also happens to run the Trump empire.Others see her new book as stunted by its class biases, which limit Ms Trump\'s advice to wealthy and powerful women. These reviewers have mocked Ms Trump\'s lament that she was so busy supporting her father during the 2016 campaign that she could not take time to get a massage or meditate for 20 minutes every morning.\n\n\n            /**/\n            (function() {\n                if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.adverts && bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync) {\n                    bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync(\'mpu\', [1,2,3]);\n                }\n            })();\n            /**/\n        \n\n\n\n\nImage copyright\nGetty Images\n\nJennifer Senior falls in the latter camp. In her New York Times review, she writes that the entire book elucidates how well Ms Trump can extend the Trump brand at every turn, writing vaguely about controversial topics, so that no one really knows what she thinks about them, and then filling most of the book with aspiration fluff. "It\'s a strawberry milkshake of inspirational quotes," Ms Senior writes. "Lee Iacocca appears two pages before Socrates. Toni Morrison appears one page after Estee Lauder. A quote from Nelson Mandela introduces the section that encourages women to ask for flexible work hours: "It always seems impossible until it\'s done." Ms Senior\'s biggest complaint is that Ms Trump leaves her most substantial and practical suggestions to the very end of the book. When it comes to family leave policies, Ms Trump sticks to the views she espoused during her father\'s presidential campaign, but doesn\'t get there until the second to last page of her book. To Ms Senior, she is missing an opportunity to advocate for changes that might help the women she is writing for.Fatima Goss Graves writes about the "women Ivanka ignores" in US News and World Report, Ms Trump misunderstands the barriers facing most women in America. "No amount of personal drive and sunny approach will ease the life of a mother of two who is struggling to pay her rent and put food on the table," Goss Graves writes. "The how-to-succeed model in "Women Who Work" overlooks the complexities of overlapping sex and race bias that drive lower pay and fewer opportunities for many women."Catherine Lucey, writing for the Associated Press, found that Ms Trump "offers earnest advice for women on advancing in the workplace, balancing family and professional life and seeking personal fulfilment." \n\n\nImage copyright\nReuters\n\nIn Cosmopolitan magazine, Kaitlin Menza - writing about the excerpt published this week in Forbes - agrees that Ms Trump is trying hard to "tear down the stereotype that parenting is easy."Whether they read Ms Trump\'s book as earnest advice or incognito marketing for the Trump name, almost everyone who reviewed Women Who Work agreed that a lot could be gleaned about the inner workings of the Trump family. Ms Trump writes about her family relationships, her work load, caring for her kids, and taking time for herself. She worries about how others may perceive her life as a working mother. And she offers a look into how her father influenced her life, and how she might influence his administration.  Avoid the book if you hate the self-help genre, Maria Puente wrote for USA Today. However, she says there are other reasons to read aside from self-improvement: "If you\'re curious about Trump, 35, who\'s taken an unpaid job as a senior adviser to her father, and how she might influence the Trump administration\'s attitudes about women," she writes. "you might want to lean in."\n', u'Ivanka Trump: How do critics like her book?']

They\'ve been shipped from one of dozens of fish farms in the sea lochs of Scotland\'s north-west coast, where they swam earlier on Sunday in a large cage, machine fed for up to three years, growing as big as 8kg.Mallaig is on a picturesque promontory looking over the sea to Skye. Its harbour used to heave with herring boats: its bracing fresh air mingled with the potent tang of smoking kippers. The wild catch at Mallaig quayside is now langoustine, scallops and lobster. Many of the shellfish are bound for markets in Spain and France, trucked live and swiftly for premium prices.The bigger fish business in the west Highlands is the farming of Atlantic salmon. \n\n\n            /**/\n            (function() {\n                if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.adverts && bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync) {\n                    bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync(\'mpu\', [1,2,3]);\n                }\n            })();\n            /**/\n        \n\nFrom the fishing boat they are vacuumed through a pipe into the ice house, slaughtered, packed and driven along the winding road through the Lochaber region to a processing plant at Fort William. They are gutted and despatched to markets around the world. By Thursday, some of the bigger fish are being served in China\'s best restaurants. Beijing first allowed imports of Scottish salmon in 2011. Last year, more than 11,000 tonnes were exported to the Far East, with a value of \xa373m ($94m).It is 25 years since Scottish salmon became the first non-French food to win the Label Rouge designation. Based on taste and appearance, that has been a valuable asset in France, the biggest European market for salmon, and an important calling card in other countries. \n\n\nImage copyright\nSSPO\n\n\nImage caption\n\n                    Firm, less fatty salmon is particularly popular for sushi and sashimi\n                \n\nSalmon is now by far the biggest food export from Scotland. In 2014, it beat confectionery to become the UK\'s biggest food export.Demand is led by the EU, which imported 35,000 tonnes of Scottish salmon last year, and the US, which imported nearly 26,000 tonnes.While the UK has less than a tenth of global production, Scotland offers a premium product, at about 10% above the world price. Scottish salmon is typically fed better quality feed, and farming can be less intensive - fewer fish in a cage mean they swim further, and develop more muscle.Loch Duart set out in 1999 to carve a niche within that Scottish niche. Farming in the sea lochs of Sutherland and the Outer Hebrides, it charges a premium of 20-25% over other salmon producers, selling to wholesalers whose high-end client chefs require that extra assurance of quality and reliability."We\'ve got to have an authentic message, a clear set of farming principles that the customer can buy into, that can be verified. We were the first to have RSPCA welfare standards," says sales director Andy Bing.Scott Landsburgh, chief executive of industry body the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation (SSPO), points out that fresh fish is hard to differentiate, except on its look. "The good quality flesh of the fish [is] particularly firm and less fatty. And that works in the sushi and sashimi market in particular," he says.\n\n\nImage copyright\nPA\n\n\nImage caption\n\n                    Unilever began Scottish salmon farming in 1965 and produced its first fish from Lochailort in 1971\n                \n\nThe journey for Scottish salmon began nearly 50 years ago. Unilever was the pioneer, spotting the potential for farmed salmon, which at that time was only caught wild and eaten as an expensive luxury.The food conglomerate\'s Marine Harvest division first produced farmed salmon in 1971 at Lochailort - the shoreline between Mallaig and Fort William - and is today the world\'s largest salmon farmer. Now an independent firm, Marine Harvest is based in Bergen, Norway, the country that dominates the industry. (Norwegian annual production has topped 1.1m tonnes, while the UK produces less than 160,000 tonnes.)Scotland\'s most valuable export - Scotch whisky - has helped to fuel the popularity of the country\'s salmon, by projecting a reputation for quality and provenance. "The inroads the whisky industry made have helped with Scotland the Brand, but salmon doesn\'t sell itself," observes Steve Bracken, spokesman for Marine Harvest and an industry veteran.He points out that producers have worked hard alongside the SSPO and the Scottish Food and Drink trade body to promote the fish. The public sector\'s contribution has been significant too, through Scottish Development International, the government agency that promotes exports.\n\n\nImage copyright\nUniversity of St Andrews\n\n\nImage caption\n\n                    Sea lice can weaken the health of salmon and their growth\n                \n\nHowever, recently Scottish salmon\'s growth has been scaled back with production hit by sea lice. When the parasites take hold of a farm, fish are harvested before their health deteriorates. That helps explain why total world tonnage was down by 7% last year - by 5% in Scotland and Norway, and 16% in Chile. The South American country is the second biggest producer of Atlantic salmon, but has been blighted by the rapid spread of fish disease.The industry has yet to get on top of sea lice. Feeder fish can be used as a predator for the parasites, but they haven\'t solved the problem yet. Another answer could be cages strong enough to be anchored far out at sea and in deeper water.\n\n\nImage copyright\nGetty Images\n\n\nImage caption\n\n                    There are about 250 salmon farming sites off the coast of Scotland and its islands\n                \n\nScottish salmon also faces an ongoing battle with environmental campaigners who fear that intensive farming in lochs and fjords is damaging to wild stocks and ecosystems.Nonetheless, demand remains healthy. Salmon is marketed as a healthy eating option.  Consumer tastes have been shifting to it as an affordable source of protein. Since 2013, salmon and trout have been the biggest category of traded fish worldwide. While Scotland\'s export tonnage fell 10% last year, its value rose by 17%.Demand for Scottish salmon is expected to remain strong despite uncertain supply and continued tough competition. In the short term, the SSPO\'s Mr Landsburgh says recent surveys suggest the tide has turned on lice."And there\'s no shortage of demand," he points out.\n', u'How Scottish salmon conquered the world']

They later ran out of fuel and were left at the mercy of the currents, surviving on raw fish, birds and rainwater. The trio said that two other crew members died because they were not able to stomach the diet, and their bodies were thrown into the sea. They denied allegations from some people that they may have been trafficking drugs or had resorted to cannibalism. When asked why they seemed to be in such good health after such an ordeal, they replied that the tuna fishermen who had rescued them had treated them very well.Lapahele Sopi and Telea Paa - \'Four months\'\n\n\n\n\nImage caption\n\n                    Lapahele Sopi and Telea Paa were rescued by a canoe - similar to this - off the coast of New Guinea\n                \n\nLapahele Sopi and Telea Paa from Samoa in the South Pacific survived for four months adrift at sea in a small metal boat.

Two other men died of thirst and starvation during the ordeal. Mr Sopi, 36 at the time, told local media they survived by eating fish and drinking rainwater.

The highest number of registrations was on the day itself, with 147,000 people registering online after Theresa May fired the election starting gun, along with 3,364 paper forms being submitted. This was the biggest total recorded for a single day since the EU referendum campaign in 2016.And the number of young people registering is the highest of any age group.General election: What you need to knowAlthough numbers have begun to drop off, there are still significant numbers of voters making sure they can have their say at the ballot box. \n\n\n            /**/\n            (function() {\n                if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.adverts && bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync) {\n                    bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync(\'mpu\', [1,2,3]);\n                }\n            })();\n            /**/\n        \n\nOn Wednesday, 83,000 registered, both online and on paper, with a further 62,400 on Thursday and 52,700 on Friday. \n\n\nImage copyright\nGov.uk\n\nThere had already been a steady stream of voters signing up ahead of the local elections being held on 4 May. A spike in the numbers on 7 April, which saw 84,600 people register in one day, has been attributed to a Facebook reminder that went out to users across the UK. The next highest day was 12 April, when 30,700 registered - a day before the registration deadline for the local elections.But on 16 April, two days before the general election was announced and after the deadline had passed for the locals, the number was down to just 5,661.  After campaigning to get more people registered in time for the last general election in 2015 and the EU referendum in 2016, the Electoral Commission said the deadline to register was "a significant motivating factor", with a spokeswoman adding: "A large number of people apply to register in the days immediately before and on the deadline itself."\'Have your say\'The biggest group getting their applications in to vote during this surge is young people. Rachael Farrington, university student and founder of Voting Counts - a campaign to encourage voters to register - said the general election was a chance for young people to have their say. "I think it is so easy to fall into the habit of not voting," she said on her blog. "Many don\'t really see how politics affects them or their lives on a day to day basis. "To this I\'d say think about what you care about, is it the education of yourself or children, the local community spaces, healthcare, or jobs in your local community?"Usually, whatever issue it is that you care about is influenced by politics in some way, so you should at least vote so that you have a say in making sure that issue is dealt with in a way you see fit."On the day the general election was called, 57,987 people under 25 registered to vote - more than any other age group. The second largest group was people aged between 25 and 34, with a further 51,341 registering.The number of new registrations declined the older people got:\n19,321 people aged between 35 to 44 registered\n10,224 people aged between 45 and 54 registered\n6,410 people aged between 55 and 64 registered\n3,676 people aged between 65 and 74 registered \n1,215 people aged over 75 registered\n\n\n\nImage copyright\nGov.uk\n\nThe previous Facebook-related spike on 7 April actually saw the 25-to-34 group with the most registrations - 31,211 people - but this was followed in second by the under-25s, with 22,138 registrations. Just 3,175 people 65 or over registered on that day.Emma Hartley, head of campaigns at the Electoral Commission, said: "It\'s really encouraging that so many young people have registered to vote recently, as our research shows that along with students and recent home movers, they are particularly less likely to be registered." But with another month until voter registration closes, there is more to be done to get people to their polling stations on 8 June.Mariam Inayat Waseem, trustee and director of the British Youth Council and a student at Newcastle University, said: "You only have to go onto social media to see how politically engaged young people are, but they are not involved in traditional ways. "Young people feel disillusioned. Decisions about their futures are being made by people without them being part of the conversation. "These decisions being taken by politicians are going to affect us, the young people, way more than they will those people who are implementing them, so we need to go out and vote and make our voices heard." The deadline to register for the general election of 2017 is 22 May. \n', u'General election 2017: How many people are registering to vote?']

But the election campaign over the coming weeks will be concentrated in the marginal battleground seats - the ones with small majorities that are most likely to change hands.There\'s no official definition of a marginal seat but people often look at constituencies where the majority - the gap between the first and second placed parties - is under 10%.\nMost marginal seats in the UK - based on 2015 results\n\nConstituency\nWinner\n2nd place\nMajority\nMajority %\n\n\nGower\nCon\nLab\n27\n0.1\n\n\nDerby North\nCon\nLab\n41\n0.1\n\n\nCity of Chester\nLab\nCon\n93\n0.2\n\n\nCroydon Central\nCon\nLab\n165\n0.3\n\n\nEaling Central & Acton\nLab\nCon\n274\n0.5\n\n\nBerwickshire, Roxburgh & Selkirk\nSNP\nCon\n328\n0.6\n\n\nYnys Mon (Anglesey)\nLab\nPC\n229\n0.7\n\n\nVale Of Clwyd\nCon\nLab\n237\n0.7\n\n\nBrentford & Isleworth\nLab\nCon\n465\n0.8\n\n\nBury North\nCon\nLab\n378\n0.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor politicians it\'s obviously a good idea to focus on these battleground seats. There\'s not much point in spending lots of time and money in constituencies that they already hold comfortably, or where they\'re so far behind they have no realistic chance of winning.There are exceptions to this. In 2015 the SNP surge in Scotland was so powerful that apparently "safe" seats fell. And the collapse of the Lib Dems saw them lose some seats they\'d held with sizeable majorities.Such large swings are rare though. And even in 2015 the Conservative/Labour fight took place almost exclusively in the battleground seats.\n\n\n            /**/\n            (function() {\n                if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.adverts && bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync) {\n                    bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync(\'mpu\', [1,2,3]);\n                }\n            })();\n            /**/\n        \n\nEighteen seats changed hands between the two biggest parties.

Its voters backed Brexit and there\'s a considerable pool of almost 7,000 voters who went for UKIP last time. That\'s one group the Conservatives will target. If they trust Theresa May to deliver Brexit, the Conservatives will argue, why vote UKIP? Picking up a decent chunk of them would be enough to overturn Labour\'s majority of 2,268.Other pro-Brexit Conservative targets in the north of England and the Midlands include Halifax, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Derbyshire North East and Walsall North. In all of them there\'s a sizeable number of people who voted UKIP in 2015 and a small Labour majority.Birmingham Edgbaston is a different sort of target. Its voters were fairly evenly split on Brexit. But it\'s a relatively prosperous part of the city which used to be a Conservative stronghold. An increase in the number of ethnic minority voters helped Labour last time round but it\'s always remained in the Conservatives\' sights. With Gisela Stuart standing down after 20 years as the MP, they\'ll see an opportunity.Wirral West is one of 10 seats lost by the Conservatives to Labour in 2015 - Esther McVey was ousted as the MP after just one term. With their current lead in the opinion polls, they\'ll be highly optimistic they can take it back - along with other seats lost in 2015 such as City of Chester, Dewsbury and Lancaster and Fleetwood.Labour targetsLabour start the election as the clear underdogs compared to the Conservatives. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hopes to win over voters during the campaign. Their top targets include Gower, Croydon Central and Renfrewshire East. \n\n\n\nGower, in South Wales, has the smallest majority of any seat in the country - a mere 27 votes. If just 14 voters switched from the Conservatives, Labour would take it so they will be campaigning for every vote. Before 2015 they\'d held it for more than 100 years and it had been considered a Labour heartland seat. Other losses from 2015 they\'ll want to reverse include Morley and Outwood, former Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls\'s old seat, and Plymouth Sutton and Devonport.In recent years London has been Labour\'s strongest region. They made seven gains here in 2015 and Sadiq Khan went on to win the 2016 mayoral election comfortably. Croydon Central was a seat they narrowly missed out on last time but they reduced the Conservative majority to just 165 votes. In a sign of their intentions, Jeremy Corbyn went to the constituency on the very afternoon that MPs voted to allow the early election. Hendon and Harrow East are other London targets Labour lost 40 Scottish seats to the SNP in 2015. In many cases the swing was so massive that they now look beyond reach. But they\'ll be looking for any signs of the beginning of a fight back. RenfrewshireEast, which used to be Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy\'s seat, is their top target. Next down the list is Edinburgh North and Leith. Lib Dem targetsThe Lib Dems are starting from a low base. They lost 49 seats in 2015, holding on to just eight, and are looking for a recovery this time. Their targets include Twickenham, Dunbartonshire East and Yeovil.\n\n\n\nAs the most pro-EU of the national parties, the Lib Dems will particularly target seats like Conservative-held Twickenham in London, which voted heavily for Remain in last year\'s referendum and where Sir Vince Cable is returning to refight his old seat. The December 2016 by-election in neighbouring Richmond Park, where they overturned Conservative Zac Goldsmith\'s 23,000 majority, showed their strategy could work.Other pro-Remain constituencies in their sights include Kingston and Surbiton and, outside of London, Bath and Cambridge - the latter held by Labour.Dunbartonshire East also voted for Remain but here they must challenge the SNP, another strongly pro-EU party. Nevertheless, the Lib Dems will think they have a chance. Jo Swinson was ousted there in 2015 when the SNP\'s vote surged by 30%. She\'s standing again and won\'t need much of that back to recapture the seat.The pro-EU message probably won\'t go down so well in Yeovil, which backed Leave in the referendum. But it\'s a constituency that the Lib Dems held for more than 30 years before it went Conservative in 2015 - Paddy Ashdown used to be the MP - and the broader south-west region used to be a stronghold for the party. Other targets here include Thornbury and Yate, on the outskirts of Bristol, and St Ives in Cornwall - a county where the Lib Dems used to dominate.Other partiesWith the SNP already holding 56 out of 59 seats in Scotland it\'s clearly impossible for them to make significant gains. But they\'ll be gunning for Labour\'s only Scottish constituency, Edinburgh South, and they\'re not far behind in Lib Dem-held Orkney and Shetland.Plaid Cymru are just 229 votes behind Labour in Ynys Mon (Anglesey). But there could also be an intriguing battle in Rhondda if party leader Leanne Wood decides to stand, even though mathematically it\'s a lot further down the target list. She achieved a tremendous 24% swing there in the Welsh Assembly election last year, so a gain is not out of the question.UKIP\'s results in 2015 demonstrated again how parties can suffer under the first-past-the-post electoral system. They received 3.9 million votes but won just one seat, Clacton, and even there the victor was Douglas Carswell, who had defected from the Conservatives. The problem UKIP have is that their vote is very evenly distributed compared to the other main parties - in fact, so much so that they\'re not even a close second in many places. Former leader Nigel Farage fell 3,000 votes short in Thanet South last time. They\'re also close in Hartlepool where the Labour MP is standing down so that may be their best chance.The Green Party are also badly served by first past the post. The only seat where they start in second place within 10% of the winner is Labour-held Bristol West. The Lib Dems are also a significant presence in that constituency and even the fourth-placed Conservatives got nearly 10,000 votes in 2015 so there a lot of possible outcomes.Northern Ireland\n\n\n\nIt may be only two years since the last general election. But in Northern Ireland it\'s less than two months since voters last went to the polls. The Assembly election held on 2 March saw gains for Sinn Fein and losses for the main unionist parties (UUP and DUP). It would be wrong to assume the general election will automatically follow the same pattern but it will certainly have an impact on the campaign.\nMarginal seats in Northern Ireland - based on 2015 results\n\nConstituency\nWinner\n2nd place\nMajority\nMajority %\n\n\nFermanagh & South Tyrone\nUUP\nSF\n530\n1.0\n\n\nBelfast South\nSDLP\nDUP\n906\n2.3\n\n\nSouth Antrim\nUUP\nDUP\n949\n2.6\n\n\nUpper Bann\nDUP\nUUP\n2,264\n4.8\n\n\nBelfast East\nDUP\nAPNI\n2,597\n6.5\n\n\nNewry & Armagh\nSF\nUUP\n4,176\n8.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSinn Fein will be eager to recapture Fermanagh and South Tyrone - reversing the loss they suffered in 2015. The swing they achieved in March would be enough to get them over the line.Belfast South is a rare three-way marginal. Both the DUP and the Alliance Party (APNI) are within 10% of the incumbent SDLP. In fact Sinn Fein is less than 11% behind as well so there are lots of possible outcomes. Perhaps the most important factor, here and elsewhere, will be whether all the parties stand. In 2015 the DUP and UUP agreed to co-operate by standing aside for each other in four constituencies. That certainly helped and the UUP have already announced they\'ll do the same again. Previously the SDLP have refused to enter any deal with Sinn Fein but they are thinking of doing so this time as part of a broader anti-Brexit alliance. That could change the complexion of a number of battleground seats.The contest in South Antrim is different. It has an overwhelming majority of unionist voters. The question is whether they\'ll back the UUP or DUP. The seat has switched between the two parties four times this century. It wouldn\'t take much of a shift for it to switch again.\n', u'The seats that could decide the election']

Mr Farron added: "You don\'t need to agree with us on everything to agree that Britain needs a strong opposition to fight for you and your communities against Tory cuts to our schools, our NHS and our social care services."In Scotland, the Conservatives want to repeat the 2016 Holyrood election which saw them replace Labour as the second largest party. New metro mayorsHowever, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has urged voters to back her party in the local elections to protest against both Conservative "austerity" and SNP plans for a second independence referendum.But Scotland\'s first minister Nicola Sturgeon said the local government elections "are not about independence". Describing them as "vitally important", she added that "a vote for the SNP in this election is a vote to protect local services".The Scottish Greens are fielding a record 218 candidates and say they are building on existing councillor numbers in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeenshire, Midlothian and Stirling, and making breakthroughs in many other local authorities.All 32 Scottish councils (1,227 seats) have elections. In 2012, the SNP won the most seats, but Labour was not far behind. Apart from Anglesey, the Welsh councils (22 councils, 1,254 seats) were last contested in 2012, That was a very strong year for Labour, which made over 200 net gains at the expense of the other parties.In England, (34 councils, 2,370 seats) this is a year of county council elections - a traditional area of strength for the Conservatives. For the first time voters in Greater Manchester, the Liverpool City region, the West Midlands, Tees Valley, the West of England and Cambridge and Peterborough will elect new metro mayors.Voting intentionsThese mayors will mostly be responsible for economic development in their regions, but some will have powers over transport and housing.Doncaster and North Tyneside are also voting for local authority mayors, who are elected leaders of their respective councils.BBC senior elections and political analyst Peter Barnes urged caution over reading too much into the results of the local elections "to project the outcome of the general election""People vote differently in council elections - even in cases when they\'re held on the same day as a general election," he said."For example, the Liberal Democrats tend to do better at the local level. And there are still five weeks to go until 8 June. So while the results that are announced on Thursday night and Friday will give us some indications about how the general election might go, they won\'t tell us with any certainty what the outcome will be."\n', u'Politicians woo voters ahead of 4 May poll']

Reviews were set up in early 2016 in 44 different areas led by local managers.Each area was asked to submit plans to NHS England, which all have done, and public consultations are due to take place later this year where major changes are being proposed.NHS England has said the programme is not about cutting services, but delivering them in more efficient and appropriate ways.It believes patients will benefit from more care in the community and say the programme will lead to a range of benefits, including:\nnew "super" community hubs of GPs, care workers and district nurses\nseven-day opening of GPs\nbetter access to hospital specialists in the community\nWhat\'s the reaction?Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb was also critical of the STP process.He said they were "based on the fantasy that there is enough money". "The Conservatives are re-organising the deck-chairs while the good ship NHS is sinking because they are starving it of funds," he added.But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "These local plans are developed by local doctors and communities, backed by the top doctors and nurses of the NHS, and will improve patient care."He said they were "underpinned" by extra funding the health service was receiving up to 2020 and that only the Conservatives could "lock in the economic progress we have made and keep improving the NHS".Analysis: Is stopping these plans credible?This is not the first time political parties have tried to make the idea of hospital cuts an issue in an election.In the run up to the 2010 general election, Tory shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley said he wanted to see a moratorium on hospital closures being proposed.Some of the changes that were being proposed back then are part of the STP process.\n\n\nImage copyright\nSCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY\n\nThe truth is closing hospital services has been a political "hot potato" for decades.While there is widespread agreement the NHS is too based around hospitals - over half of the budget is spent on them - changing the status quo has proved difficult.NHS England has argued shifting care into the community will save money and also benefit patients by providing care in the community and closer to their home.In theory, that will help them get care at an earlier stage before their condition worsens. Some have estimated that could help save a third of the \xa322bn efficiency target.If this is not to happen, Labour needs to set out how it will make savings or whether it will increase the NHS budget by more than is currently planned - and how that will be paid for.Read more from NickFollow Nick on Twitter\n\n\n\n1.

Mrs Trump\'s rapidly changing expression also led to the "Free Melania" campaign, as people around the globe speculated the former model was being forced into a role she did not want, by a husband she potentially wasn\'t overly fond of.But like all good stateswomen, Mrs Trump refused to be drawn into the speculation.\nWho is Melania Trump?\nBillionaire to give away \'lion\'s share\' of fortune\nIvanka Trump: How do critics like her book?\nOn Tuesday, that appeared to change.The Slovenian-born First Lady "liked" a tweet which seemed to suggest she either finds the jokes funny, or that the Free Melania campaigners were right.\n\n\n            /**/\n            (function() {\n                if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.adverts && bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync) {\n                    bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync(\'mpu\', [1,2,3]);\n                }\n            })();\n            /**/\n        \n\nIt all started when left-wing blogger Andy Ostoy sent this tweet:\n\n\nImage copyright\nTwitter/@AndyOstroy\n\nSo far, so normal.

Which may point to a third option: not that she found the tweet funny, not that Free Melania campaigners were right, but that the swiftly removed "like" was, in fact, the work of a Twitter novice.Of course, there are other possibilities. Mrs Trump may have been the victim of a hack, or someone else could have logged into her account.It will remain a mystery for now. Attempts to get the White House to comment on the "like" by US media have so far yielded no results.Either way, those watching the Trumps\' marriage closely will no doubt use this as further proof all is not well between the First Couple.\n', u"Has Melania Trump 'liked' a tweet mocking her marriage?"]

These are the first accounts to show their impact on the whole group.Once their sales are added in, overall group sales increased 12.7% Merging the operations has produced cost savings of \xa3130m and a profit contribution from Argos of \xa377m.Mr Coupe said: "We have opened 59 Argos Digital stores in Sainsbury\'s supermarkets and they are performing well. We are therefore accelerating our plan to open a total of 250 Argos Digital stores in Sainsbury\'s supermarkets.""We continue to find ways to simplify our business and reduce costs. We are on track to deliver our three-year \xa3500m cost saving programme by the end of 2017-18 and we will deliver a further \xa3500m of cost savings over three years from 2018-19."\n\n\nImage copyright\nGetty Images\n\nMarket shareSainsbury\'s is also seeing a change in shopping habits, with customers making more trips to smaller stores, but spending less on each trip. Sales in Sainsbury\'s convenience stores grew more than 6%, while those in its big supermarkets fell 2%.The supermarket is also facing pressure from discounters like Aldi and Lidl.Research group Kantar released a report showing Sainsbury\'s market share slipped from 16.5% to 16.1% of the UK market in the 12 weeks to 23 April. It has the second largest market share, behind Tesco with 27.5%.Asked whether Sainsbury\'s would ever catch up Tesco, Mr Coupe told the BBC: "I think that\'ll be a long time coming , but the acquisition of the Home Retail Group has added quite a lot to our top line, and our market share has been remarkably resilient."Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: "Sainsbury\'s faces a squeeze on several fronts. "On one side, there are discounters like Aldi and Lidl crushing prices and stealing market share, while Tesco and Morrisons are both in the middle of strong turnaround programmes that are leaving Sainsbury\'s trailing."Sainsbury\'s shares were the biggest faller on the London FTSE 100 index, dropping more than 2% in the first 20 minutes of trade.The full-year dividend paid to shareholders has been reduced by 15.7% to 10.2p a share.\n', u"Sainsbury's warns of rising costs as profits fall 8.2%"]

But for the local Maori, the volcano is considered the burial ground of the tribe\'s ancestor and is itself seen as an ancestor.Traditionally, even just climbing to the top of the peak is inappropriate and only very rarely done for ceremonial purpose. How prevalent is the naked tourist photo?Since the country was colonised by the British, the local tribe often had very little say regarding the mountain - which was named Mount Egmont by Captain Cook - and today accept that tourists want to climb the beautiful volcano. "It\'s only recently that we can have some input on what goes on at the mountain," the local Maori spokesman explains. "We simply ask people to please be respectful. This latest case is just another really annoying example where someone obviously didn\'t know how to behave here."Mayor of the local Stratford district, Neil Volzke, agrees the move was culturally insensitive. "I don\'t think the picture itself is offensive or obscene - it is just inappropriate to take on top of Mount Taranaki because it is a place with great deal of importance for the Maori community," he told the BBC.  A clash of beliefsWhen Ms Cook\'s nude photo began to draw criticism, she defended herself - saying she did research before and thought taking the picture was not offensive. But local Maori were left somewhat puzzled."It\'s a clash between Western assumptions and indigenous values and beliefs," Mr Ngaware says.Previous incidents on Taranaki have also outraged the local Maori community, including a group of hikers taking a barbecue to the peak for a summit grilling session, and people leaving graffiti on the mountain."It\'s a place that should be treated with the utmost respect at all times," insists Mr Volzke. \n\n\nImage copyright\nTIM STEWART NEWS LIMITED\n\n\nImage caption\n\n                    Nude shots of tourists on Malaysia\'s Kinabalu mountain caused massive outrage\n                \n\nThis is not the first time that a nude picture on a mountain has drawn condemnation from local communities.In June 2015, a group of Western tourists climbing Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia caused massive outrage and a subsequent deadly earthquake was blamed on their disrespect towards the sacred mountain.

It\'ll be her age that causes a stir. This is the first year the age restriction of 50-years old or under has been removed from the qualifying conditions for the prize.She is not the only seasoned artist on the list. In fact, all of those shortlisted are comfortably middle-aged.It is also the most international feeling list for this national prize. Each of the four artists has strong links with cultures and counties beyond the UK, which reflects the globalised nature of the art world and the real world.Frankly, age and origin matter not a bit. What\'s important is whether or not they are any good, and do they - as the Turner Prize demands - represent developments in contemporary art? My answer would be firm "yes" to the former, and a more equivocal "not really" to the latter. From a medium point of view, the list has a rather old-school feel about it, with two painters, a film-maker and a woodcutter - all of whom are making good work which I\'m looking forward to seeing in what could be a memorable group show.Find out more about the nominees:Hurvin Anderson\n\n\nImage copyright\nHurvin Anderson\n\nOne of Britain\'s leading contemporary painters, Anderson takes inspiration from his youth in Birmingham\'s African-Caribbean community and visits to Trinidad. Barber shops feature regularly - they are places where he says both cultures meet.He\'s nominated for exhibitions in Nottingham and Ontario, Canada. The centrepiece of the Nottingham exhibition was a painting titled Is It Okay To Be Black? - a half-remembered view of a barber shop\'s wall featuring Martin Luther King and Malcolm X.The Tate judges described him as "an outstanding British painter whose art speaks to our current political moment with questions about identity and belonging".Andrea Buttner\n\n\nImage copyright\nBrian Forrest\n\nButtner\'s works have included a video of nuns who work in a funfair in Italy and woodcuts of faceless beggars.She is interested in poverty, religion and shame. The judges said she highlights the "overlooked and undervalued", and were impressed with the wide range of media used - including "unfashionable" formats like woodcuts and glass painting. Her materials range from plywood - for woodcuts featuring simple, lonely figures - to fabric from workers\' uniforms and high-visibility jackets.The jury also "noted Buttner\'s unique approach to collaboration and her exploration of religion, morality and ethics". The 45-year-old is based in London and Berlin, and is shortlisted for exhibitions in Switzerland and Los Angeles.Lubaina Himid\n\n\nImage copyright\nStuart Whipps\n\nDescribed by The Daily Telegraph as "the under-appreciated hero of black British art", Himid made her name in the 1980s as one of the leaders of the British black arts movement - both painting and curating exhibitions of similarly overlooked black female artists.The Zanzibar-born, Preston-based artist is now professor of contemporary art at the University of Central Lancashire and was made an MBE in 2010.She\'s nominated for solo shows in Bristol and Oxford. The Bristol show centred on larger-than-life cut-outs of 100 colourful figures - 17th Century African slave servants brought to Europe. Another work, Cotton.com, imagined conversations between the cotton workers of Lancashire and the slaves of South Carolina. The Turner Prize judges praised her for "addressing pertinent questions of personal and political identity".Rosalind Nashashibi\n\n\nImage copyright\nRosalnind Nashashibi\n\nFourteen years after she won the \xa324,000 Beck\'s Futures Prize, film artist and painter Nashashibi is nominated for the Turner. Nashashibi was born in Croydon, south London, to Irish-Palestinian parents. She is nominated for an exhibition in California that included the film Electrical Gaza, which used live footage and animation to investigate everyday life in Gaza.She\'s also nominated for her contribution to the Documenta 14 exhibition in Athens, including a film about mother-and-daughter artists in self-imposed exile in Guatemala.The jury said they were impressed by the "depth and maturity" of her work, which "often examines sites of human occupation and the coded relationships that occur within those spaces".\n\n\n\nThe exhibition of work by this year\'s shortlisted artists runs at the Ferens gallery in Hull - the UK\'s City of Culture for 2017 - from 26 September to 7 January.\n\n\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
